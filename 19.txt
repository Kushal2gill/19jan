Q1 : Describe higher order functions
 ans :  A Higher-Order function is a function that receives a function as an argument or returns the function as output.
  .map() >> .map() method executes a callback function on each element in an array. It returns a new array made up of the return values from the callback function

   .filter() Method >>
   The .filter() method executes a callback function on each element in an array. The callback function for each of the elements must return either true or false. The returned array is a new array with any elements for which the callback function returns true.

    .reduce() Method >>
    The .reduce() method iterates through an array and returns a single value.


    Q2 :  write use cases + any one code example for map, filter and reduce.
    .map() method 
    Map can be used when we want to perform an action on each element in a collection, and gather the results into a new array. 
    ex we want to multiple each elements by 2 

    code -----------
    const dblArr = arr.map((num) =>{
    return num*2;
 })
   console.log(dblArr);



   .filter method
   The filter() method creates a new array filled with elements that pass a test provided by a function.
   ex 
   let arr2 = [45, 23, 21, 0, 3, 5]
   let a2 = arr2.filter((a) => {
  return a < 10
})
console.log(a2)
in the new array on those elements are present which are less than 10


.reduce() method
arr.reduce() method in JavaScript is used to reduce the array to a single value

const sum = arr.reduce((acc,num) =>{
    return acc +=num;
},0);
